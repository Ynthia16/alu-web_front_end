# Responsive Web Design Project

This project focuses on responsive web design techniques and concepts. By the end of this project, you will understand:

Mobile-first design: Starting with mobile layout and progressively enhancing for larger screens.
Media queries: Applying different styles based on device characteristics using CSS.
Sizes for responsive design: Common breakpoints like 320px, 768px, and 1024px for different devices.
Making a website responsive: Fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries for optimal viewing experience.
Differences between responsive and adaptive design: Responsive adapts fluidly, while adaptive uses predefined layouts.
CSS units for flexibility: Percentage (%), viewport units (vw, vh), and flexible boxes.

Let's build responsive websites together!
